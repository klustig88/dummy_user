Dummy User:

Simple Application that explores and implements user authentication.

The app allows for a user to:

1. Sign up
2. Login
3. Display a user-only page for logged in users


Also has a focus on sessions to keep current users logged in while making sure
that a user that is not logged in will not be able to view the user-only page.
